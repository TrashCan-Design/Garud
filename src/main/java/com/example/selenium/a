follow the given instruction and generate all code : 1) Generate all files the tech stack is python, and i want a backend server to which the frontend written in react could communicate 2) It will be hosted on localhost only backend server at 7000 port 3) The backend server will be written in .js only. For web crawling and all python file would be used. It should be like the frontedn sends data to backed then backend in .js calls python files which will run the web crawler in python passing along information like like ip or website name. Note the frontend will only take input as website name or ip . The python will perform test and report vulnerabilities found to backend which would be sent to frontend
